# UncoverFoundationedOceans Mod
This mod allows you to uncover oceans that you have paved over.  
The way it works is to reset the terrain height to the original and reverse the amount of soil used in the process  

~~I would like for it to be non-cheaty, but right now, the calculations seem to give back a tiny bit more soil than it uses to flatten. I will be working on it in the future though, and hopefully I'll be able to make it match vanilla soil calculations at some point~~  
As of [v0.0.2](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/Raptor/UncoverFoundationedOceans/0.0.2/), soil calculations are exactly reversible, though they are still a teensy bit off the vanilla calculations.

Please contact me in case of any bugs, or if you have suggestions to improve this mod

## How to use this mod
* First install the mod, and reboot the game.
* Hold Ctrl when placing foundations to uncover the foundation. Make sure to use the "no decoration" foundation if you want to be able to see the ocean since the foundation colors are applied irrespective of the terrain height.
