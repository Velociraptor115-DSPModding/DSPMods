# ExposeCreativeMode Mod
This mod allows you to enable "Creative Mode" and play without limitations (Well, atleast without a few limitations)  
Note that this most of the functionality in this mod will tip off abnormality detection in-game, so do not use it on a save which you want
to upload to the Milky Way.

## How to use this mod
* First install the mod, and reboot the game.
* Press Shift + F4 to toggle creative mode  
  (**Note**: Enabling creative mode will auto-enable Infinite Inventory, Instant Build and Instant Research)
* When in creative mode
  * Ctrl + T : Unlocks all techs
  * Numpad 3 : Flattens the entire planet using the planet's default colors  
    (**NEW**) Now you can set the foundation "level" of the planet  
    Hold the Ctrl and Shift keys while pressing this keybind to undo the foundation effect  
    None - Default effect of flattening planet  
    Ctrl - Restore shallow oceans  
    Shift - Restore mid-level oceans  
    Ctrl + Shift - Restore deep oceans  
  * Numpad 4 : Toggles bury/raise all veins on the planet
  * Ctrl + Numpad 6 : Toggles Instant Research mode. You can lock / unlock specific tech in the tech tree screen and also increase / decrease the research level of infinite research.  
    Hold the "Lock Research" keybind (default: L) to lock / decrease research.  
    You can also use the Ctrl and Shift keys to modify the number of levels to increase / decrease.  
    None - 1, Ctrl - 10, Shift - 100, Ctrl + Shift - 1000  
  * Ctrl + Numpad 2 : Toggles Instant Build mode
  * Ctrl + Numpad 1 : Toggles infinite inventory mode  
    (**Note**: Infinite Inventory is skipped when saving game data, so you will have your previous inventory when you load it the next time)
  * Ctrl + Numpad 0 : Toggles infinite station mode  
  (**WARNING**: This probably does not do what you think it does. Read the description carefully before trying it out)
  * Infinite Power, Infinite Reach - passive enhancements that are automatically enabled when in creative mode

All controls are rebindable. I have removed a few redundant options from the previous versions. I will be adding a few extra options as well in the future.  
In case you were using a particular option that I have removed and you would like it back, please contact me on Discord or raise an issue on GitHub. In the meantime, you can go back to [version 0.0.3](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/Raptor/ExposeCreativeMode/0.0.3/) which has the most options, but no rebindability. 

### Infinite Inventory mode

* Makes the player inventory have all items present in the game
* All items are reset to 9999, with the stack size being 30000 every frame
* Because the stack is greater, items which go into the inventory are effectively "deleted"

### Infinite Station mode

* This mode is primarily for testing blueprints, by making stations infinitely output to belt and consume from belt without needing any drones/vessels
* Makes all stations set to supply have items less than half of max
* Makes all stations set to demand have items more than half of max
* In the case of ILS, only remote supply/demand is checked. If remote is set to storage, then local is taken

### Infinite Power
* All buildings connected to a power network will work at 100% regardless of the amount of power supply
* Buildings not connected to a power network will still **NOT** work

### Infinite Reach
* You can now inspect, interact with, build and delete items across the entire planet. Inspect works even in Planet View mode
